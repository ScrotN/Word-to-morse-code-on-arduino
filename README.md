This is my first arduino setup project. I don't have that many electronic components, so this is as simple as I can make it. I don't know much about arduino and this is just my second day of working with it. So, bare with it.


With my setup, the code seems to fail to upload every time pin 2(RX0) is connected to ground(GND). So every time I need to upload a new code, pin 2 must not be connected to ground(GND) or I'll have to unplug the board, unplug the ground(GND) from pin 2(RX0), plug the board with my PC, then upload again
